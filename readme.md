## Rebuilding Turing's Futbol Project

I've now worked with a number of Turing students on the [futbol](https://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/futbol/index) project.

There's a few consistent spots that they tend to get stuck on, but I'm not familiar enough with the right solution to guide them to it.

Also, I've always enjoyed re-writing Turing projects. They usually take a tiny fraction of the time they took me in Turing, and I gain an appreciation for design patterns I've read about in books like [Eloquent Ruby by Russ Owens (2011)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9364729-eloquent-ruby?ac=1&from_search=true#) and Sandy Metz' famous [Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Object-Oriented-Design-Ruby-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321721330)

I'm building this resource with several goals and related constraints in mind:

### Goals

- share information in a way that advances the learning of a broad number of people, "beginner" through at least "intermediate".
- advance the related goals I've got described on [intermediateruby.com/about](https://intermediateruby.com/about)
- do this _quickly_. for a variety of reasons, I'm working on "shipping quickly"
- advance the state of current Turing students who avail themselves of this resource, _even if it's while they're doing the Futbol project_
- be accessible enough that someone who isn't even _in_ Turing could follow along, and probably gain some useful knowledge along the way. At minimum they'd get a laugh from at least one or two gifs ahead.


### Constraints

- time, current knowledge
- I desire to "follow the path of most value", and I plan on this resource or a related resource to some day convey the kind of learning in a short enough time that people would plausibly spend non-trivial resources to learn more from. 
- I've been typing for 10 minutes and I'm hoping to have at least some of this project done in the next 30 minutes

---------------

_user's guide: this is a guide explaining how I've created Turing's futbal project from scratch. I've never done it before, I'll try to avoid making any leaps, but when I _do_ lose you, please open an issue on this repo expressing as much. If you're not sure what that means, DM me in slack.

# Steps

I'll outline my steps in stream-of-consciousness style, or as minimally-modified stream-of-consciousness as possible, _from absolute scratch_.

I'll include links to specific commits, so you can "follow along" this repo a bit better. I'll be starting from `mkdir futbol` and `git init`.

I use a `today-i-learned` repo, and as I work through the following resources, I'll update it and link to it in various ways.

I would advocate for almost everyone reading these words to use a resource like the above.


## `mkdir` new project folder:

```
mkdir  futbol
cd futbol
atom readme.md
```

This is what I've done for the above. I'll commit it via:
